Minecraft Fabric mod to disable villagers

This mod has 4 configuration options:

killVillagers: kills all loaded villagers. usually this means that no villagers are ever visible

spareExperiencedVillagers: only takes effect, if the above setting is true. Villagers that have been traded with have experience, so if you want to keep some villagers but prevent more from spawning, set this to true

disableVillages: prevents village structures from spawning in the world

curedZombieLoot: if this option is set to null, curing zombie villagers is impossible.
By supplying lootTable data (for example generated on https://misode.github.io/loot-table/ ), zombie villagers die when they are completely healed and drop the configured loot.

 

This mod requires Fabric API
